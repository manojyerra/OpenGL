*) By double click on object other objects should be invisible and pivot point should be object position and fit it in screen properly.
*) Short cut key for Ortho and Perspective Views.
*) Short cut key for Pause physics.
*) Model Props Frame should work when physics enabled.
*) Main Frame should work when physics enabled.
*) FLModel transformation should be able to copy and set when physics off.
*) Memory leaks needs to be fixed for physics mainly.
*) Show only selected objects option should be there in Main Frame.
*) Add shourt cut key for bounding shapes visibility.
*) glScissor usage: Button, Label, TextField, CheckBox etc... Font is going out of frame needs to fixed.
*) Find proper way to clear array memory. ex : int* arr = new int[100]; delete[] arr; (or) delete arr;
*) Add pre fix and post fix for SUITextField component.	
*) Physics options in model frame props for Mass as text fields.
*) Calculate mass based bounding shapes volume.	
*) Physics Props Box
	Mass 		: xxxx
	Volume		: xxxx
	Meterial 	: xxx
				  xxx
				  xxx
				  xxx
	Calculate Mass by Meterial and volume.	
*) Camera box ( with below TextFields ) 
	Perspective
	Ortho
	Tranlation
	Rotation
	Pivot
	

//////////////////////// Begin : Later /////////////////////////
	
*) Remove scaling option for FLModel
*) Delete bounding shapes.
*) Undo and Redo options.
*) Crash issue needs to be fixed while scaling the object.
*) Cylinder bounding shape depth configration.
*) When Physics enabled automatically view should changed to perspective and ortho should not work ( ortho should work only when physics paused or disabled. )
*) Proper help to use the tool.
*) Add text field for object name.
*) Show message box while saving FLModel and it should show dialog box if object name already exists
*) When enter key is clicked on object name text field and object name is already exist, it should show dialog box saying "Object name is already exists".
*) Ctrl + S for saving FLModel.
*) Save Options ( should be there in Main frame for all objects ).
	Save Transformation
	Save AABB
	Save Bounding Shapes
	Save All
*) Confirmation box before saving ( not message box ).
*) Delete option for model should be there in Main Frame and short cut key should be there.
*) Duplicate option on model should be there in Main Frame and short cut key should be there ).
*) Load model(s) option should be there.
*) Multiple objects selection should be there and it should perform below operations.
	Transformation
	Delete
	Duplicate
	Apply transformation of object from physics enabled state to disable state.
*) Duplicate objects should be saved by new folder.

*) Remove save option from paste rotation button click event.
*) Copy paste should be there for tranlation box.
*) Repalce Labels with TextFields.
*) Add message box for copy and save options.
*) glScissor usage : SUIFrame and text is going out of frame needs to fixed.
*) Need to check PhyCylinder and PhyCone after setting height as height/2.0f
